Test repository for JIRA integration purposes

I should create an OAuth access token on the DVCS (in this case GitHub). 
I should create the access token on the account that owns the repositories you want to link. How you create the token depends on the DVCS.

The values that make up the token are:
key	- A string generated by the DVCS.
secret	- A string generated by the DVCS.
authorizing account	- The account that authorizes the token
